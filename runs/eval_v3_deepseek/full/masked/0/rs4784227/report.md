## Ranked chains

### 1. H1: GATA3 binds the alt allele more strongly at a TOX3 distal enhancer and increases breast cancer risk (p = 0.46)

TF GATA3 (QBiC-SELEX coverage own_model), alt allele binds more; element ENSR16_9QTBS / EH38E3180851 dELS; gene TOX3; cell type MCF7 breast cancer cell line.

| Step | Claim | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| binding | GATA3 is the best-supported GATA factor here: it is highly expressed and occupied over the variant in MCF7, and both the GATA3 own-model QBiC-SELEX result and the stronger GATA2-mapped GATA model detect an alt-increasing binding change with a strong alt site; ChIP occupancy itself is not allele-specific. | supported | [E04](#e04), [E06](#e06), [E20](#e20), [E35](#e35) |
| element | The variant lies in the ENSR16_9QTBS enhancer and in the EH38E3180851 distal enhancer-like cCRE with DNase and H3K27ac marks, supporting an active regulatory element, although these marks are maxima over biosamples and not allele-specific. | supported | [E01](#e01), [E03](#e03), [E04](#e04) |
| gene | TOX3 is the nearest protein-coding gene at 17.5 kb and is the Open Targets L2G target for breast-cancer credible sets at this variant, but this variant has no significant GTEx v8 eQTL in breast or other tissues, so the enhancer-to-TOX3 link remains genetic/computational rather than expression-QTL-proven. | weak | [E02](#e02), [E16](#e16), [E17](#e17), [E37](#e37) |
| cell_type | MCF7 is relevant because GATA3 is expressed at very high levels there and MCF-7 GATA3 ChIP-seq peaks contain the variant. | supported | [E06](#e06) |
| phenotype | The T allele is the strongest reported breast-cancer effect allele and the credible set maps to TOX3, so alt-enhanced GATA3 binding could raise TOX3 expression and risk if GATA3 activates this enhancer, but activation direction and TOX3 expression change are not demonstrated. | weak | [E15](#e15), [E16](#e16), [E18a](#e18a) |

Predictions: Allele-specific GATA3 ChIP in MCF7 or base-edited cells shows stronger GATA3 occupancy on the T allele at this base.; GATA3 depletion reduces the alt-specific enhancer-reporter effect in breast cancer cells.

Falsified if: Controlled allele-specific assays show no GATA3 binding difference or stronger binding to the C allele.; The variant changes enhancer activity independently of the GATA3 site, or TOX3 expression is unchanged in a relevant breast-cell context.

### 2. H2: FOXA1 binds the alt allele more strongly at the TOX3 enhancer and modulates breast cancer risk (p = 0.28)

TF FOXA1 (QBiC-SELEX coverage own_model), alt allele binds more; element ENSR16_9QTBS / EH38E3180851 dELS; gene TOX3; cell type MCF7 breast cancer cell line.

| Step | Claim | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| binding | FOXA1 is expressed and occupied over the variant in MCF7, and its own-model QBiC-SELEX result plus the FOXA2-mapped model detect an alt-increasing change with a strong alt site; FOXA2/FOXA3 are below 1 TPM here, so FOXA1 is the relevant forkhead factor, though ChIP is not allele-specific. | supported | [E04](#e04), [E05](#e05), [E21](#e21), [E36](#e36) |
| element | The variant lies in an active distal enhancer-like element marked by DNase and H3K27ac, compatible with FOXA1 binding at a regulatory element, although the chromatin z-scores are not MCF7-specific or allele-specific. | supported | [E01](#e01), [E03](#e03), [E04](#e04) |
| gene | TOX3 is 17.5 kb away and receives high Open Targets L2G scores for breast-cancer credible sets, but the absence of a significant GTEx v8 eQTL for this variant in breast or other tissues means the enhancer-to-TOX3 link is not yet proven by expression QTL data. | weak | [E02](#e02), [E16](#e16), [E17](#e17), [E37](#e37) |
| cell_type | MCF7 is relevant because FOXA1 is expressed there and MCF-7 FOXA1 ChIP-seq peaks contain the variant. | supported | [E05](#e05) |
| phenotype | The T allele is the strongest reported breast-cancer effect allele and the credible set maps to TOX3, so alt-enhanced FOXA1 binding could alter TOX3 enhancer activity and risk, but FOXA1 can act context-dependently and the direction of its effect is not proven. | weak | [E15](#e15), [E16](#e16), [E18a](#e18a) |

Predictions: Allele-specific FOXA1 ChIP in MCF7 or base-edited cells shows stronger FOXA1 occupancy on the T allele at this base.; FOXA1 depletion reduces the alt-specific enhancer-reporter effect in breast cancer cells.

Falsified if: Controlled allele-specific assays show no FOXA1 binding difference or stronger binding to the C allele.; FOXA1 occupancy at the element is independent of this variant and does not affect TOX3 regulatory activity.

### 3. H4: No TF-mediated effect of this exact base; association is explained by linkage or another mechanism (p = 0.21)

Null chain: no TF-mediated effect of this variant.

Predictions: This base has no allele-specific TF binding or enhancer-activity effect; the breast cancer signal is driven by a linked causal variant or another element.; The variant may be a passenger in a regulatory region, or the apparent regulatory signal comes from nearby sites rather than this C>T change.

Falsified if: A controlled allele-specific assay shows this exact base changes TF occupancy and enhancer activity in breast cells.; Fine-mapping and functional assays exclude linked variants and show this C>T is the causal regulatory base.

### 4. H3: NR2F2 binds the alt allele more strongly and may modulate TOX3 enhancer activity (p = 0.05)

TF NR2F2 (QBiC-SELEX coverage own_model), alt allele binds more; element ENSR16_9QTBS / EH38E3180851 dELS; gene TOX3; cell type MCF7 breast cancer cell line.

| Step | Claim | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| binding | NR2F2 is expressed and occupied over the variant in MCF7, and its QBiC-SELEX collection detects a weaker alt-increasing change, but the best model is CIS-BP-mapped from PPARG and occupancy is not allele-specific, making this binding evidence weak. | weak | [E08](#e08), [E22](#e22) |
| element | The variant is in a distal enhancer-like cCRE with active chromatin marks, compatible with NR2F2 binding at a regulatory element. | supported | [E01](#e01), [E03](#e03) |
| gene | TOX3 is the nearest protein-coding gene and the Open Targets L2G target for the breast-cancer credible set, but there is no breast-tissue GTEx eQTL for this variant, so the enhancer-gene link is computational. | weak | [E02](#e02), [E16](#e16), [E17](#e17), [E37](#e37) |
| cell_type | MCF7 is relevant because NR2F2 is expressed there and MCF-7 NR2F2 ChIP-seq peaks contain the variant. | supported | [E08](#e08) |
| phenotype | If alt-enhanced NR2F2 binding changes TOX3 enhancer activity, it could influence breast cancer risk, but NR2F2 can be context-dependent and repressive, so the phenotype direction is uncertain. | weak | [E15](#e15), [E16](#e16) |

Predictions: Allele-specific NR2F2 ChIP shows stronger binding to the T allele at this base in MCF7.; NR2F2 perturbation changes enhancer activity or TOX3 expression in a direction consistent with its role at this element.

Falsified if: No allele-specific NR2F2 binding is observed, or binding is not dependent on this base.; NR2F2 perturbation does not alter the enhancer or TOX3 expression in relevant breast cells.

## Prediction matrix

| Test | Cost | Separates top two | H1 | H2 | H4 | H3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Allele-specific ChIP-qPCR/ddPCR for GATA3 and FOXA1 over the variant in MCF7 cells heterozygous for C/T or in isogenic base-edited MCF7 cells | medium | yes | GATA3 shows stronger binding to the T allele at this base; FOXA1 does not show an allele-specific change. | FOXA1 shows stronger binding to the T allele at this base; GATA3 does not show an allele-specific change. | Neither GATA3 nor FOXA1 shows allele-specific binding at this base; any binding is independent of the C>T change. | NR2F2, rather than GATA3 or FOXA1, shows allele-specific binding at this base. |
| Enhancer reporter assay in MCF7 comparing ref and alt alleles, with GATA3 knockdown versus FOXA1 knockdown | medium | yes | The alt reporter has higher activity and GATA3 knockdown reduces the alt-specific effect. | The alt reporter has higher activity and FOXA1 knockdown reduces the alt-specific effect. | No allele-specific reporter activity is seen, or any difference is not dependent on GATA3, FOXA1, or NR2F2. | The alt reporter activity is changed by NR2F2 perturbation, with little or no GATA3/FOXA1 dependence. |
| CRISPR base editing of C>T at the endogenous locus in MCF7 followed by GATA3/FOXA1 ChIP and TOX3 expression measurement | high | yes | Editing increases GATA3 occupancy at the element and increases TOX3 expression. | Editing increases FOXA1 occupancy at the element and increases TOX3 expression. | Editing does not change TF occupancy or TOX3 expression, or the effect is not attributable to this base. | Editing changes NR2F2 occupancy and TOX3 expression without GATA3/FOXA1 dependence. |
| Existing GTEx and Open Targets eQTL/L2G review for this variant and TOX3 in breast tissue | existing data | no | No breast eQTL is present, so the TOX3 link remains L2G-based and does not distinguish GATA3 from FOXA1. | No breast eQTL is present, so the TOX3 link remains L2G-based and does not distinguish FOXA1 from GATA3. | No breast eQTL is consistent with, but does not prove, a non-expression-mediated or linked-variant explanation. | No breast eQTL is present, so the TOX3 link remains L2G-based and does not distinguish NR2F2 from other TFs. |

## Next experiment

Perform allele-specific GATA3 and FOXA1 ChIP-qPCR/ddPCR over the variant in MCF7 cells that are heterozygous C/T, or in isogenic MCF7 cells generated by CRISPR base editing of C>T; this is the cheapest test that directly separates the top two chains by asking which TF binds the T allele more strongly at this exact base.

> QBiC-SELEX screen of chr16:52565276:C>T, one line per TF, each with the TF's own or CIS-BP-mapped model of largest |z|. Candidates are TFs whose ENCODE ChIP-seq peaks contain the variant and that are expressed (DepMap line ACH-000019), bound here before bound elsewhere, then a strong site before a weak one, then by |z|; then expressed TFs ENCODE never assayed whose best model passes the gate (occupancy unknown). Shown: 10 of 95 occupied (27 with a strong site), 5 of 75 with unknown occupancy. Left out: 45 TFs assayed in the matching biosample and 411 assayed only elsewhere, none with a peak here; 22 bound but below 1 TPM. The gate (|z| > 4.05, Bonferroni over 997 models) marks a change QBiC-SELEX detects; it says nothing about occupancy. Effect > 0 means the alternate allele binds more strongly. In vitro binding only. Site strength is the better allele's best k-mer over the variant, as a percentile of the best model's k-mers; a strong site reaches the 97.5th. At a weak site the ChIP peak more likely reflects another site in the element.
