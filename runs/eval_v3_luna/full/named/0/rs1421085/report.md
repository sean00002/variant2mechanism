## Ranked chains

### 1. H1: Null: no TF-mediated effect at rs1421085 (p = 0.78)

Null chain: no TF-mediated effect of this variant.

Predictions: In relevant adipose precursor cells, changing T to C will not produce a reproducible TF-dependent regulatory effect attributable to this base. The obesity association may reflect linkage or a mechanism not established by the supplied evidence.

Falsified if: Editing this base in a relevant adipose precursor model produces a reproducible allelic regulatory effect that depends on a specific TF.

### 2. H2: ATF3-mediated effect at the enhancer-like element (p = 0.08)

TF ATF3 (QBiC-SELEX coverage own_model), alt allele binds more; element EH38E3181208; gene FTO; cell type Adipose - Subcutaneous (preadipocyte-like proxy).

| Step | Claim | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| binding | ATF3's own QBiC-SELEX model predicts stronger in-vitro binding to alt C, but this does not establish occupancy in adipose precursors. The variant-overlapping ChIP peak is from HCT116, and no matching preadipocyte peak is reported; absence may also reflect lack of an assay. ATF3 is a candidate, not a demonstrated mediator. Its bZIP-related candidate JUN also has an alt-favoring model, so the evidence does not distinguish them; ATF3 has the larger predicted binding effect, while JUN is more highly expressed in the proxy. | weak | [E04](#e04), [E05](#e05), [E09](#e09), [E20](#e20), [E35](#e35), [E36](#e36) |
| element | The variant lies in the enhancer-like cCRE EH38E3181208. The nearby SCREEN record is EH38E3181207, and the reported activity maxima are not biosample-specific, so they do not establish activity of the variant-containing cCRE in adipose precursors. | supported | [E03](#e03) |
| gene | FTO is prioritized for associated traits by L2G, but the supplied evidence does not connect EH38E3181208 directly to FTO. The reported FTO eQTL is in skeletal muscle, not adipose. | weak | [E02](#e02), [E16](#e16), [E17](#e17) |
| cell_type | Subcutaneous adipose is a plausible context because ATF3 is expressed there, but it is only a proxy for preadipocytes and no relevant-context ATF3 occupancy is shown. | weak | [E04](#e04), [E09](#e09), [E35](#e35) |
| phenotype | The variant is strongly associated with obesity, with ref T reported as the effect/risk allele. This does not establish that an ATF3-to-FTO effect mediates the association or whether greater ATF3 binding increases or decreases regulatory activity. | supported | [E15](#e15), [E16](#e16) |

Predictions: In relevant adipose precursor cells, ATF3 should occupy the variant-containing element and show greater occupancy or binding on C than T; ATF3 perturbation should alter the element's activity in an allele-dependent manner.; Compared with the null chain, this model predicts an ATF3-dependent effect of T versus C. It does not specify the direction of FTO expression change.

Falsified if: Relevant-cell assays show no ATF3 occupancy or no ATF3-dependent difference between T and C in element activity.

### 3. H4: TEAD1-mediated effect at the enhancer-like element (p = 0.08)

TF TEAD1 (QBiC-SELEX coverage own_model), alt allele binds more; element EH38E3181208; gene FTO; cell type Adipose - Subcutaneous (preadipocyte-like proxy).

| Step | Claim | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| binding | TEAD1's own QBiC-SELEX model predicts stronger in-vitro binding to alt C, but this does not establish occupancy in adipose precursors. Its variant-overlapping ChIP peak is from HepG2, and no matching preadipocyte peak is reported; absence may also reflect lack of an assay. | weak | [E04](#e04), [E12](#e12), [E21](#e21), [E37](#e37) |
| element | The variant lies in the enhancer-like cCRE EH38E3181208. The nearby SCREEN record EH38E3181207 and biosample-unspecified activity maxima do not establish activity of the variant-containing cCRE in this context. | supported | [E03](#e03) |
| gene | FTO is prioritized for associated traits by L2G, but the supplied evidence does not directly connect EH38E3181208 to FTO. The reported FTO eQTL is in skeletal muscle, not adipose. | weak | [E02](#e02), [E16](#e16), [E17](#e17) |
| cell_type | Subcutaneous adipose is a plausible context because TEAD1 is expressed there, but it is only a proxy for preadipocytes and relevant-context TEAD1 occupancy is not shown. | weak | [E04](#e04), [E12](#e12), [E37](#e37) |
| phenotype | The variant is strongly associated with obesity, with ref T reported as the effect/risk allele. The association does not establish that a TEAD1-to-FTO chain mediates it or the regulatory direction. | supported | [E15](#e15), [E16](#e16) |

Predictions: In relevant adipose precursor cells, TEAD1 should occupy the variant-containing element and show greater occupancy or binding on C than T; TEAD1 perturbation should alter element activity in an allele-dependent manner.; Unlike the ATF3 and JUN chains, this model predicts TEAD1 dependence. It does not specify the direction of FTO expression change.

Falsified if: Relevant-cell assays show no TEAD1 occupancy or no TEAD1-dependent difference between T and C in element activity.

### 4. H3: JUN-mediated effect at the enhancer-like element (p = 0.06)

TF JUN (QBiC-SELEX coverage own_model), alt allele binds more; element EH38E3181208; gene FTO; cell type Adipose - Subcutaneous (preadipocyte-like proxy).

| Step | Claim | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| binding | JUN's own QBiC-SELEX model predicts stronger in-vitro binding to alt C, but the variant-overlapping ChIP peak is from HepG2, not adipose precursors. No matching preadipocyte peak is reported; this may reflect lack of an assay. JUN is highly expressed in the adipose proxy. ATF3 is a related bZIP candidate with a larger predicted in-vitro binding effect, and the evidence does not establish which, if either, mediates an effect. | weak | [E04](#e04), [E05](#e05), [E22](#e22), [E36](#e36) |
| element | The variant lies in the enhancer-like cCRE EH38E3181208. The nearby SCREEN record EH38E3181207 and biosample-unspecified activity maxima do not establish activity of the variant-containing cCRE in this context. | supported | [E03](#e03) |
| gene | FTO is prioritized for associated traits by L2G, but no evidence directly links this cCRE to FTO. The reported FTO eQTL is in skeletal muscle, not adipose. | weak | [E02](#e02), [E16](#e16), [E17](#e17) |
| cell_type | Subcutaneous adipose is a plausible context given JUN expression, but it is only a proxy for preadipocytes and relevant-context JUN occupancy is not shown. | weak | [E04](#e04), [E05](#e05), [E36](#e36) |
| phenotype | The variant is strongly associated with obesity, with ref T reported as the effect/risk allele. The association does not establish that a JUN-to-FTO chain mediates it or the regulatory direction. | supported | [E15](#e15), [E16](#e16) |

Predictions: In relevant adipose precursor cells, JUN should occupy the variant-containing element and show greater occupancy or binding on C than T; JUN perturbation should alter element activity in an allele-dependent manner.; Unlike the ATF3 and TEAD1 chains, this model predicts JUN dependence. It does not specify the direction of FTO expression change.

Falsified if: Relevant-cell assays show no JUN occupancy or no JUN-dependent difference between T and C in element activity.

## Next experiment

The cheapest informative test of the top two hypotheses (H1 null and H2 ATF3) is a matched T-versus-C element reporter assay in a relevant adipose precursor model with ATF3 perturbation, testing for an allele-by-perturbation interaction. A positive interaction supports H2 over H1; no interaction weakens H2, though a negative result would not exclude other TFs or endogenous-context effects.

> This meta-analysis provides strong evidence that FTO polymorphisms, particularly rs1421085 and rs9939609, are significantly associated with increased susceptibility to obesity in adults, while their impact on overweight is comparatively weaker.

> Based on findings that experimental manipulation of the RNA m6A methylation in animal experiments can affect anxiety, and given that the C-allele of FTO rs1421085 had a significant association with indicators of overweight and obesity in our previous study, we have examined the possible association of FTO rs1421085 genotype with neuroticism in the same longitudinally observed sample.

> QBiC-SELEX screen of chr16:53767042:T>C, one line per TF, each with the TF's own or CIS-BP-mapped model of largest |z|. Candidates are TFs whose ENCODE ChIP-seq peaks contain the variant and that are expressed (GTEx tissue median Adipose - Subcutaneous), bound here before bound elsewhere, then a strong site before a weak one, then by |z|; then expressed TFs ENCODE never assayed whose best model passes the gate (occupancy unknown). Shown: 10 of 16 occupied (10 with a strong site), 5 of 157 with unknown occupancy. Left out: 0 TFs assayed in the matching biosample and 554 assayed only elsewhere, none with a peak here; 3 bound but below 1 TPM. The gate (|z| > 4.05, Bonferroni over 997 models) marks a change QBiC-SELEX detects; it says nothing about occupancy. Effect > 0 means the alternate allele binds more strongly. In vitro binding only. Site strength is the better allele's best k-mer over the variant, as a percentile of the best model's k-mers; a strong site reaches the 97.5th. At a weak site the ChIP peak more likely reflects another site in the element.
