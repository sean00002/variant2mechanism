## Ranked chains

### 1. H1: TCF7L2-dependent regulation of POU5F1B (p = 0.46)

TF TCF7L2 (QBiC-SELEX coverage mapped), ref allele binds more; element The variant lies in pELS cCRE EH38E3858447, but its target gene is not established.; gene POU5F1B; cell type HCT116 cells are a candidate context for testing this mechanism..

| Step | Claim | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| binding | TCF7L2 is expressed and ChIP-bound over the variant in HCT116. QBiC-SELEX predicts stronger binding to ref G in a CIS-BP-mapped LEF1 model; another mapped TCF-family model also detects a change, but there is no TCF7L2-specific model here. This makes TCF7L2 a plausible, not confirmed, allele-sensitive factor. The strong predicted site and HCT116 occupancy favor it over candidates whose changes are weak or not detected, but do not establish TF-specific binding. | weak | [E05](#e05), [E20](#e20), [E35](#e35) |
| element | The variant lies in enhancer-like pELS cCRE EH38E3858447; the evidence does not show which gene this element regulates. | supported | [E01](#e01), [E03](#e03) |
| gene | POU5F1B is a candidate target because it is nearby, has a T-associated increase in transverse-colon expression, and has genetic-association support for colorectal cancer. These data do not connect this cCRE to POU5F1B or establish that the eQTL is mediated by TCF7L2. | supported | [E02](#e02), [E17](#e17), [E37](#e37) |
| cell_type | HCT116 is a relevant test context because TCF7L2 occupancy over the variant and expression of TCF7L2 are reported there; this does not establish the mechanism in primary colorectal tissue. | supported | [E04](#e04), [E05](#e05) |
| phenotype | One possible model is that ref-favored TCF7L2 binding represses POU5F1B, so T increases its expression and could contribute to colorectal cancer susceptibility. The repressive role and causal chain are unproven, and colorectal cancer association records do not resolve the risk-allele direction across studies. | weak | [E15](#e15), [E17](#e17), [E18a](#e18a), [E18b](#e18b), [E18c](#e18c), [E37](#e37) |

Predictions: In an allele-specific TCF7L2 binding assay, ref G should bind more strongly than alt T.; If TCF7L2 represses this element, T should increase POU5F1B expression relative to G; disrupting TCF7L2 binding should diminish that expression difference.

Falsified if: A suitably powered allele-specific assay finds no TCF7L2 binding difference between G and T.; Variant editing produces no reproducible POU5F1B regulatory difference, or TCF7L2 perturbation does not affect that difference.

### 2. H3: No TF-mediated effect of this variant (p = 0.37)

Null chain: no TF-mediated effect of this variant.

Predictions: Changing G to T will not reproducibly cause a TF-dependent change in local regulatory activity or target-gene expression.; The association may reflect linkage to another causal variant or a mechanism not mediated by TF binding at this base.

Falsified if: Isogenic variant editing reproducibly changes allele-specific TF occupancy and regulatory output, and perturbing the implicated TF removes or materially reduces the effect.

### 3. H2: SP1-dependent regulation of POU5F1B (p = 0.09)

TF SP1 (QBiC-SELEX coverage own_model), ref allele binds more; element The variant lies in pELS cCRE EH38E3858447, but its target gene is not established.; gene POU5F1B; cell type HCT116 cells are a candidate context for testing this mechanism..

| Step | Claim | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| binding | SP1 is expressed and ChIP-bound over the variant in HCT116. The SP1-specific QBiC-SELEX model does not detect a clear allelic change; the ref-favoring signal comes from a CIS-BP-mapped SP4 model and is at a weak predicted site. Thus SP1 occupancy is supported, but an SP1-specific allelic binding effect is weakly supported. | weak | [E06](#e06), [E22](#e22), [E36](#e36) |
| element | The variant lies in enhancer-like pELS cCRE EH38E3858447; no evidence directly assigns this element to POU5F1B. | supported | [E01](#e01), [E03](#e03) |
| gene | POU5F1B is a candidate target based on proximity, the T-associated transverse-colon eQTL, and colorectal cancer genetic-association support, but mediation by this cCRE or by SP1 is not demonstrated. | supported | [E02](#e02), [E17](#e17), [E37](#e37) |
| cell_type | HCT116 is a plausible test context because SP1 occupancy over the variant and SP1 expression are reported there. | supported | [E04](#e04), [E06](#e06) |
| phenotype | If ref-bound SP1 represses POU5F1B at this element, T could increase POU5F1B and affect colorectal cancer susceptibility. Neither SP1 repression nor this causal disease mechanism is established, and the association records do not resolve risk-allele direction. | weak | [E15](#e15), [E17](#e17), [E18c](#e18c), [E37](#e37) |

Predictions: A direct SP1-specific assay should find greater binding to ref G than alt T; the current SP1-specific QBiC-SELEX model does not itself provide clear support for this prediction.; If ref-bound SP1 represses POU5F1B, T should increase POU5F1B expression, and SP1 perturbation should reduce the allele-dependent expression difference.

Falsified if: SP1-specific allele assays show no reproducible binding difference and SP1 perturbation has no effect on allele-dependent regulation.; The proposed expression direction is absent in a context where the element is active.

### 4. H4: SRF-dependent regulation of POU5F1B (p = 0.08)

TF SRF (QBiC-SELEX coverage own_model), ref allele binds more; element The variant lies in pELS cCRE EH38E3858447, but its target gene is not established.; gene POU5F1B; cell type HCT116 cells are a candidate context for testing this mechanism..

| Step | Claim | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| binding | SRF is expressed and ChIP-bound over the variant in HCT116. Its own QBiC-SELEX model detects stronger binding to ref G, but the predicted site is weak, so the ChIP peak may reflect another site in the element rather than allele-sensitive binding at this base. | supported | [E09](#e09), [E21](#e21) |
| element | The variant lies in enhancer-like pELS cCRE EH38E3858447; the evidence does not establish this element's target gene. | supported | [E01](#e01), [E03](#e03) |
| gene | POU5F1B is a candidate target based on proximity, its T-associated transverse-colon eQTL, and colorectal cancer genetic-association support; no evidence links this cCRE to POU5F1B through SRF. | supported | [E02](#e02), [E17](#e17), [E37](#e37) |
| cell_type | HCT116 is a plausible test context because SRF occupancy over the variant and SRF expression are reported there. | supported | [E04](#e04), [E09](#e09) |
| phenotype | An SRF-dependent change in POU5F1B regulation could affect colorectal cancer susceptibility, but SRF's regulatory direction, the element-to-gene connection, and the causal link to disease are not established. Association records also disagree on risk-allele direction. | weak | [E15](#e15), [E17](#e17), [E18c](#e18c), [E37](#e37) |

Predictions: An allele-specific SRF assay should find greater binding to ref G than alt T, although the weak predicted site makes a null result plausible.; If ref-bound SRF activates POU5F1B, T should lower POU5F1B expression; this direction differs from the T-associated increase reported in transverse colon.

Falsified if: A suitably powered SRF-specific assay shows no allele-dependent binding at the variant.; SRF perturbation does not affect any allele-dependent POU5F1B response through this element.

| Allele-specific EMSA using G and T probes with TCF7L2-specific validation (for example, supershift or competition controls). | low | yes | Greater TCF7L2-specific binding to the G probe. | No reproducible allele-dependent TF binding attributable to this variant. | No necessary TCF7L2-specific G-versus-T difference; the proposed factor is SP1. | No necessary TCF7L2-specific G-versus-T difference; the proposed factor is SRF. |
| Allele-specific SP1 binding assay in HCT116, followed by SP1 perturbation if a difference is detected. | medium | no | No SP1-specific allelic effect is required; TCF7L2 binding should be the more relevant effect. | No reproducible allele-dependent SP1 binding or SP1-dependent regulatory output. | Greater SP1 binding to G and an SP1-dependent allele effect on regulatory output. | No SP1-specific allelic effect is required; SRF is the proposed factor. |
| Allele-specific SRF binding assay in HCT116, with SRF perturbation to test regulatory dependence. | medium | no | No SRF-dependent allele effect is required; TCF7L2 is the proposed factor. | No reproducible allele-dependent SRF binding or SRF-dependent regulatory output. | No SRF-dependent allele effect is required; SP1 is the proposed factor. | Greater SRF binding to G and an SRF-dependent allele effect on regulatory output. |
| Isogenic G-to-T editing in HCT116 followed by POU5F1B expression measurement with and without TCF7L2 perturbation. | high | yes | T increases POU5F1B under the proposed repression model, and TCF7L2 perturbation reduces the allele-dependent difference. | No reproducible allele-dependent POU5F1B expression effect or TF-dependent interaction. | Any allele-dependent expression effect should track SP1 perturbation rather than TCF7L2 perturbation. | Any allele-dependent expression effect should track SRF perturbation rather than TCF7L2 perturbation. |

## Next experiment

Run the low-cost TCF7L2-specific allele-probe EMSA with G and T sequences and supershift or competition controls. Greater TCF7L2-specific binding to G would support H1 over the null; no difference would weaken its central binding premise. This tests binding directly but would not by itself establish regulation of POU5F1B or a disease effect.

> QBiC-SELEX screen of chr8:127401060:G>T, one line per TF, each with the TF's own or CIS-BP-mapped model of largest |z|. Candidates are TFs whose ENCODE ChIP-seq peaks contain the variant and that are expressed (DepMap line ACH-000971), bound here before bound elsewhere, then a strong site before a weak one, then by |z|; then expressed TFs ENCODE never assayed whose best model passes the gate (occupancy unknown). Shown: 10 of 64 occupied (19 with a strong site), 5 of 133 with unknown occupancy. Left out: 6 TFs assayed in the matching biosample and 497 assayed only elsewhere, none with a peak here; 6 bound but below 1 TPM. The gate (|z| > 4.05, Bonferroni over 997 models) marks a change QBiC-SELEX detects; it says nothing about occupancy. Effect > 0 means the alternate allele binds more strongly. In vitro binding only. Site strength is the better allele's best k-mer over the variant, as a percentile of the best model's k-mers; a strong site reaches the 97.5th. At a weak site the ChIP peak more likely reflects another site in the element.
